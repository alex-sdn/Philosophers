# Philosophers
This project serves as an introduction to multithreading and mutexes in C, through the classic Dining Philosophers problem.

The program takes as arguments, in this order:
- Number of philosophers
- Time to die
- Time to eat
- Time to sleep
- Number of times each philosopher must eat for the simulation to end (optional)

<sup>(times are in milliseconds)</sup>
